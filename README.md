We accept email on your behalf, we then process it as you request and send it to your web application as a HTTP POST or HTTP GET request (email to web / email to HTTP) - your choice.

# why email2http
When your product requires email address verification at any stage, it becomes really painful to automate your test suite. There are some big fans of mocking and dependency injection, I am not one. I do not believe in running the product in "DEBUG" mode while running automated test suites, hence email2http.
